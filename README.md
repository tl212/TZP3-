## Overview 

The main objective of this project is to contruct a system to increase performance capability in speed and accuracy updating our [first model](https://columbia.bootcampcontent.com/Zee/movies_rec_project_3) as a starting point.

## Project Content
1. Load data
..1.2 The Dataset 
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Build Recommender Systems
..* 3.1 Content Based `recosys` 
..* 3.2 Collaborative Filtering `recoSys`
..* 3.3 SVD - Singular Value Decomposition `reco`
4. Hybrid RecoSys Engine 


1. Import our dependencies
2. Load dataset
3. Understand dataset
4. Data Wrangling (Already done)
5. Pre-processing steps (We will perform the pre-processing steps as and when needed)
6. Build recommendation system
   6.1 Simple recommendation system
        6.1.1 Implement model
        6.1.2 Evaluate Result
    6.2 Content based recommendation system
        6.2.1 Implement model
        6.2.2 Evaluate Result
    6.3 CF based recommendation system
        6.3.1 Implement model
        6.3.2 Evaluate Result
    6.4 Hybrid recommendation system
        6.4.1 Implement model
        6.4.2 Evaluate Result
Deep dive into the bottleneck of item-based collaborative filtering.
